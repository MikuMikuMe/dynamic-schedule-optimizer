Below is a sample Python program for a dynamic schedule optimizer. The program utilizes basic scheduling principles and assumes a simplified scenario. For a fully optimized and scalable solution, you might consider implementing advanced algorithms or incorporating third-party libraries or APIs designed for scheduling, like Google Calendar APIs.

Here's the Python program:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import random

class ScheduleOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize with some default values
        self.appointments = []  # List to store the appointments
        self.working_hours = (9, 17)  # Working hours from 9 AM to 5 PM

    def add_appointment(self, start_time: datetime, duration: int, client_name: str):
        """
        Add a new appointment.

        :param start_time: The start time of the appointment
        :param duration: Duration of the appointment in minutes
        :param client_name: Name of the client
        :return: None
        """
        end_time = start_time + timedelta(minutes=duration)

        # Check if the appointment is within working hours
        if not (self.working_hours[0] <= start_time.hour < self.working_hours[1]):
            print(f"Appointment for {client_name} is outside of working hours.")
            return

        # Check for any overlap with existing appointments
        for appt in self.appointments:
            if (start_time < appt['end_time'] and end_time > appt['start_time']):
                print(f"Appointment for {client_name} overlaps with another appointment.")
                return

        # Add the appointment to the list
        self.appointments.append({'start_time': start_time, 'end_time': end_time, 'client_name': client_name})
        print(f"Appointment added for {client_name} from {start_time} to {end_time}.")

    def suggest_time_slot(self, duration: int):
        """
        Suggest an optimal time slot within the working hours for a new appointment.

        :param duration: Duration of the appointment in minutes
        :return: Suggested start time
        """

        # Start searching from the beginning of the working hours
        check_time = datetime.combine(datetime.now().date(), datetime.min.time().replace(hour=self.working_hours[0]))

        while check_time.hour < self.working_hours[1]:
            end_time = check_time + timedelta(minutes=duration)

            # Check for any overlap or if it falls outside of working hours
            if (end_time.hour < self.working_hours[1] and 
                all(not (check_time < appt['end_time'] and end_time > appt['start_time']) for appt in self.appointments)):
                print(f"Suggested time slot: {check_time} to {end_time}")
                return check_time

            # Increment time by a small amount, e.g., 15 minutes, to find the next possible slot
            check_time += timedelta(minutes=15)

        print("No available time slots found.")
        return None

    def display_appointments(self):
        """
        Display all scheduled appointments.
        
        :return: None
        """
        if not self.appointments:
            print("No appointments scheduled.")
        else:
            print("Scheduled Appointments:")
            for appt in sorted(self.appointments, key=lambda x: x['start_time']):
                print(f"{appt['client_name']} - {appt['start_time']} to {appt['end_time']}")

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    scheduler = ScheduleOptimizer()
    
    try:
        # Add some appointments
        scheduler.add_appointment(datetime.now().replace(hour=9, minute=30), 60, "Client A")
        scheduler.add_appointment(datetime.now().replace(hour=11, minute=0), 45, "Client B")
        
        # Display current appointments
        scheduler.display_appointments()
        
        # Suggest a time slot
        scheduler.suggest_time_slot(30)

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### Explanation:

- **Class `ScheduleOptimizer`:** The main class that handles scheduling operations.
- **`add_appointment`:** Method to add a new appointment, checking for conflicts and working hours.
- **`suggest_time_slot`:** Utilizes a simple search to find the next available slot, avoiding conflicts with current appointments.
- **`display_appointments`:** Lists all appointments, sorted by start time.
- **Main block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)**: Demonstrates how to use the `ScheduleOptimizer` class.

This is a foundational structure for a schedule optimizer program. For enhancement, consider integrating more sophisticated scheduling algorithms and perhaps even machine learning models for predicting optimal time slots based on historical data.
